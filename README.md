# Data-Wrangling

Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.

Data wrangling tends to be the most redundant and mind-numbing process associated with building Machine Learning (ML) models. There are four steps to building an ML model: data processing, data cleaning, feature engineering, and finally, model selection. Yet many ML automation platforms ignore the first three steps (data wrangling) of the model building process completely and focus on model selection. Model selection typically involves iterating through hundreds of models to find a model and set of model hyper-parameters which optimally capture the distribution of the data. Unfortunately, once you have a nicely formatted, cleaned, and featurized data-set, model selection is a rather academic task.
